# Non-primative data types - hold/store multiple pieces of data

# List - Array - collection of data - indexed - mutable (can be changed)

# Tuple similar to list - collection of data, is indexed but immutable (cannot be changed)

# used to list data that will not change like days of the week

names = ("John", "Jane", "Mike" )
#           0       1       2
